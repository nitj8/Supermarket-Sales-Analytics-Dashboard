# Supermarket-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard
Power BI Supermarket Sales Dashboard with complete data model, DAX measures, retail analytics visuals, and interactive reporting features. Includes embedded supermarket assets and optimized report layout.
This repository contains a Power BI Sales Dashboard built to analyze supermarket-style retail sales data. The PBIX file has been reverse-engineered to extract its visual structure, resources, and internal configuration. The dashboard includes multiple analytical pages, KPI cards, category-level visuals, and product-wise performance charts. It uses a fully modeled semantic layer consisting of fact tables and dimension tables that support detailed analysis and drill-down capabilities.

The report leverages advanced Power BI features such as dynamic filtering, slicers, bookmarks, relationship management, reusable DAX measures, and optimized visuals. Images embedded in the PBIX file (such as supermarket6375022387958521.png and other retail-themed assets) indicate the dashboard is structured around retail store sales, product categories, and revenue insights. The layout file shows multiple visual containers, resource packages, and KPI elements structured across the report canvas.

This solution is intended for analysts, BI developers, and organizations looking to understand how to build a retail-focused analytical dashboard covering product performance, customer trends, revenue movement, and operational KPIs. The PBIX file includes a built-in supermarket theme and supports immediate customization with your own data.
